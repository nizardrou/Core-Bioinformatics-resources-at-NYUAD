# Core Bioinformatics Resources
The repo is intended as a collection of the resources that are available through the Core Bioinformatics at NYUAD.

Here, you will find information on:

- The Core Bioinformatics team members, the organisation of the team, and their areas of expertise.
- How to interact and get in touch with the team, and raise specific requests.
- The data SOPs (archiving and retrieval of data, sharing of data, and submission of data to public repositories).
- Using the inhouse LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) and submitting samples for sequencing.
- Primary sequence analysis using GURU (Genomics seqUencing Run aUtomation).
- Project management using JIRA.
- Downstream analysis using NASQAR.
- The in-house developed Workflow management system BioSAILs and the production level YAML workflows available.
- Bioinformatics software ecosystem on the NYUAD HPC cluster Jubail (GENCORE modules).
- The HPC front-end interface.
- Customizing your submissions on the HPC including tips and tricks on how to get the best performance out of your analysis.



## The Team

The Core BioInformatics at New York University Abu Dhabi was established to provide a nexus for cutting-edge life sciences research in the United Arab Emirates, with world-class facilities and resources to promote innovative advances in genomics and systems biology.

Our focus is to provide computational infrastructure and services for sequence analysis in support of a wide range of research projects. The team develops analytical pipelines, joint genomics resources, training programs, data policies, and handles data management.

The team’s mission is to:
- Establish and maintain high throughput computational pipelines.
- Collaborate and support NYUAD’s multidisciplinary research programs.
- Provide Scientific project management solutions to researchers.
- Establish and maintain data management solutions.
- Provide expert scientific consultation and advice.
- Bioinformatics training and personal development to the wider NYUAD community.
- Develop new tools and resources for the analysis, visualization and management of high throughput genomics datasets.

The team focuses on the following types of analysis:
- Resequencing and structural variation analysis.
- De novo genome and transcriptome assembly.
- Metagenomic (amplicon and shotgun) assembly and analysis.
- Epigenetic analysis.
- Gene finding and annotation.
- Expression analysis (differential gene expression and transcriptome profiling) on whole and Single Cell RNAseq.
- Integrative genomics analysis (scRNA, scATAC, Proteome, Metabolome).
- ML/DL analysis modelling.

Our team includes individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences, which enables us to target the focus areas mentioned above.

- Kristin C Gunsalus - Director of Bioinformatics CGSB.
- Nizar Drou - Bioinformatics Lead Developer CGSB.
- Muhammad Arshad - Bioinformatics Data Analyst CGSB.
- Jayaram Radhakrishnan - Bioinformatics Infrastructure Engineer CGSB.
- Guiseppe Antonio Saldi - Data Computational Scientis.
- Nabil Rahiman - Bioinformatics Full Stack Developer CGSB.

## MISO

Our LIMS is based on the open source MISO software https://github.com/miso-lims/miso-lims.
If you are interested in submitting samples for sequencing at NYUAD, you will have to have the relevant information added in MISO.

You will first need to open an account on our MISO instance, and you can do that by filling out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx3CxLrFb7FRh0hZlUfy2V-n85u1OTxSKngCoCzqyEs9psNQ/viewform).

Our MISO instance can be accessed here https://miso.abudhabi.nyu.edu/.

We have also added a [quick video](https://youtu.be/vE5mFv-zMpk) MISO tutorial.

Once you have opened your account successfully, you will be able to start submitting samples for sequencing, and if you face any issues, then please let us know using the email address nyuad.cgsb.cb@nyu.edu.
